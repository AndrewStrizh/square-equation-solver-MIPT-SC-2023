 *\mainpage Square equation solver
 *\section ABOUT
 *A simple and intuitive solver of quadratic equations. Written in C as a task at the MIPT Summer
 *School 2023.
 *The project is launched via the console using a makefile. The documentation for the project is
 *written using Doxygen.
 *To start testing the program, you can use the TEST_SOLVE_SQUARE macro in the file tests.cpp.
 *If you specify the tests argument when running through make, the erroneous tests will be saved to
 *this file. If you want to use YouPlot to plot your equation, then you need to install it,
 *you can do this with the help of the brew install youplot command.
