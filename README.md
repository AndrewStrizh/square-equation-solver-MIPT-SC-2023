# square-equation-solver-MIPT-SC-2023
A simple and intuitive solver of quadratic equations. Written in C as a task at the MIPT SummerSchool 2023. The project is launched via the console using a makefile. The documentation for the project is written using Doxygen. To start testing the program, you can use the TEST_SOLVE_SQUARE macro in the file tests.cpp. If you specify the tests argument when running through make, the erroneous tests will be saved to this file. If you want to use YouPlot to plot your equation, then you need to install it, you can do this with the help of the ```brew install youplot command```.
